# Blog Series: The Pendant Problem

A three-part technical blog about using Bayesian ranking to find the perfect Valentine's gift.

## Structure

1. **Part 1: The Pendant Problem** - The Valentine's backstory and why pairwise comparison beats absolute ranking
2. **Part 2: TrueSkill Demystified** - Understanding μ, σ, and how beliefs update after each match  
3. **Part 3: The Pair Selection Puzzle** - EΔσ + Thompson Sampling for smart pair selection

## Outline

### Part 1: The Pendant Problem
- **Hook**: Valentine's Day is coming, 200+ pendant options, decision paralysis
- **The Problem**: Rating 200 items 1-5 stars is cognitively exhausting
- **The Insight**: Pairwise comparison is natural ("Which do I prefer?")
- **The Math Question**: But that's 200×199/2 = 19,900 possible pairs! How do we pick smartly?
- **Preview**: Introduce the app concept, tease TrueSkill

### Part 2: TrueSkill Demystified  
- **Origin Story**: Xbox matchmaking (2007), why it works for ranking
- **The Bayesian Mindset**: Every item has uncertain skill, each match updates our beliefs
- **μ (mu)**: The best estimate of true skill
- **σ (sigma)**: How uncertain we are about that estimate
- **Conservative Score**: μ - 3σ (don't let lucky newcomers dominate)
- **The Update**: How rate_1vs1() shrinks uncertainty
- **Mermaid Diagram**: Flow of a single comparison

### Part 3: The Pair Selection Puzzle
- **The Dilemma**: Explore uncertain items vs. exploit known rankings
- **Naive Approaches**: Random? Round-robin? Both waste comparisons
- **EΔσ (Expected Uncertainty Reduction)**: The Bayesian gold standard
  - Compute expected info gain for each pair
  - Pick the most informative comparison
- **Thompson Sampling**: Natural explore/exploit via posterior sampling
- **The Hybrid**: 75% EΔσ + 25% Thompson for the best of both worlds
- **Mermaid Diagram**: Complete algorithm flow
- **Results**: App screenshots showing convergence
